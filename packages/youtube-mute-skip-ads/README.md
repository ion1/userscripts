# YouTube Mute and Skip Ads

Mutes, blurs and skips ads on YouTube. Speeds up ad playback.

The consistent skipping (rather than ad blocking) on the desktop seems to make more ads skippable on the mobile as well when logged in as the same user. ([This Android app](https://github.com/alfeugds/adskipper#readme) mutes and skips ads in the YouTube app.)

Clicks "yes" on "are you there?" on YouTube Music.

## Installing

1. Install a browser extension such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
2. Add [YouTube Mute and Skip Ads](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/461341-youtube-mute-and-skip-ads) to it.
